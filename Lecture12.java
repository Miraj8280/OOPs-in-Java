/*
    Q1. What is Inheritance?

    => When we constract a new class from an existing class in such a way that the new class access all the features and properties of existing class is called Inheritance.

    => In java, 'extends' keyword is used to perform inheritance.

    => It provides code reusability.

    => We can't access private members of class through inheritance.

    => A sub-class contains all the features of super-class. So, we should create the object of sub-class.

    => Sub-class : Newly created class.
    => Super-class : Existing class from which the sub-class is created.

    => Method overriding only possible through inheritance.

    => Syntax:
                class A {


                }

                class B extends A {


                }

    => Types of Inheritance:

                i) Single(or, Simple) Inheritance.
                ii) Multi-level Inheritance.
                iii) Multiple Inheritance (java does not support)
                iv) Hierarchical Inheritance
