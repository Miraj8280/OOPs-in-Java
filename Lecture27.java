// Interface:
/*
    => Interface is just like a class, which contains only abstract method.

    => To achieve interface, java provides a keyword called 'implements'.

    => Interface methods are by default public and abstract.

    => Interface variables are by default public, static and final.

    => Interface method must be overriden inside the implementing classes.

    => Interface nothing but deals b/w client and development.
